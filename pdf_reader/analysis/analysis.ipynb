In a level-based learning path, a sequence of levels can also be defined (e.g., beginner, advanced, expert), which a user can reach if he successfully completes all courses of the corresponding level.

       " 'text': 'Learning paths illustrate long-term training plans that run over several courses. These can consist of a mixture of online courses, blended learning courses and classroom training. For a better organisation, it is possible to create folders in the learning path manager, which describe different phases of the learning path. Dependencies can also be created between the individual courses, like the learning logic in courses. Prerequisites can also be assigned. By using learning logic rules, you can map open learning concepts with a freely selectable processing sequence as well as closed scenarios in which the sequence is defined step-by-step. Two learning path modes are available: content-oriented and level-based. A content-oriented learning path is used to provide and track structured content over a longer period, e.g., for a 6-month onboarding programme where a series of courses must be completed. In a level-based learning path, a sequence of levels can also be defined (e.g., beginner, advanced, expert), which a user can reach if he successfully completes all courses of the corresponding level. The defined levels can be linked to conditions and access restrictions. Fig. 6.1: Learner’s view: learning path panel The layout of learning paths was developed together with the course room to ensure a smooth transition between learning path and course. Fig. 6.2: Learner’s view: curriculum of a learning path Learners can obtain, if configured, certificates either on the overall learning path and, for level- based learning paths also on everyone achieved level. Learners can, for example, book learning paths themselves via the catalogue. The information available for a learning path on the detail page can be configured using imc Learning Suite. A preview image also motivates participation in learning paths. Supervisors also have the option of booking learners directly to courses within a learning path. Like courses, learning paths also support automatic booking. Via the participant management, learning path creators can define groups and job profiles for which they then define conditions for automatic booking. In addition, it is also possible to define that courses contained in the path are also automatically booked for the learner when they are booked on the learning path. Learning paths can also be used in the recertification process. Accurate recertification periods can be specified, with the ability to add different recertification content for each period. The learn- ing path administrator will find separate settings for this in the backend. If the learning path needs to be cancelled, the cancellation applied on learning path level can be automatically applied to the courses contained in the learning path.',\n",
